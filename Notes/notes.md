# Agent

Agents are a piece of memory that contains states or list/elements

```elixir
# Create the agent as a buffer with a active process 
{:ok,agent}=Agent.start_lint fn -> [] end 

# Add element to my memory 
Agent.update(agent, fn list -> ["eggs | list"]end ) #Add an element to my list 

# Get the elements from my memory 
result = Agent.get(agent, fn list -> list end )
#result = ["eggs"]

# Stop the Agent and stop the process
Agent.stop(agent)
```

# Genserver

Genserver is a process used it to create a registry that can monitor bucket processes with different functionalities. This is because giving a process name takes a lot of server memory and then it could crash.

```elixir
defmodule GenericServer do
	
	# Init the server
	def init(param) do
	IO.puts("Init server")
	{:ok, %{count:0}} #return a tuple with the ok value and an initial memory state 
	end

	# Function that receive message from the client 
	def handle_call(message, _from, state) do #_from means that I don't need to use it 
		IO.puts(message)
		result ="Hello From the server"
		{:reply, result, state} #This is the response of the server	
	end
end
```

This function, handle_call return a server response to the client, this could be a problem because if the server is delayed the client have to wait until some response (or the timeout error). Instead of this exist another function that doesnâ€™t return anything to the client, just make a server petition and finish. Here is the example:

```elixir
# Function that receive message from the client 
		def handle_cast(message, state) do #The message is the data that I want to send 
		{:noreply, state} #When the handle_cast is correct return a :noreply
		{:reply, result, state} #This is the response of the server	
	end
```
